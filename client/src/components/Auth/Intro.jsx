                  Whether youâ€™re looking for a tool to record your daily
                  emotions and activities in a reflective journal, keep track of
                  milestones in a food diary or pregnancy journal, or even
                  record your dreams in a dream journal, Penzu has you covered.
                  Penzu gives you all the tools you need to focus on the ideas
                  you want to preserve, rather than the process of writing
                  itself.
